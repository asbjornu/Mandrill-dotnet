## Description

Mandrill Dot Net is a library that wraps the [Mandrill](http://mandrill.com/) mail API to easily get started in sending mail. It contains methods that accepts requests that matches the structure of the Mandrill API docs. Required properties are accepted in the Request's constructor.

## Usage

Reference the `Mandrill.dll` library in your project or download from NuGet.

#### Api Docs

[https://mandrillapp.com/api/docs/](https://mandrillapp.com/api/docs/)

#### Example

    MandrillApi api = new MandrillApi("xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx");
    UserInfo info = await api.UserInfo();
    Console.WriteLine(info.reputation);

All endpoints are covered by integration tests and can be used as a reference.

## Necessary prerequisites

### .NET Core 5

NetCore5 can be supported easily by replacing dependency on Flurl or when Flurl upgrades to Core.

### .NET 4.5

This wrapper uses [Flurl.Http](http://tmenier.github.io/Flurl/), which uses .NET 4.5.

###.NET 4

Support for .NET 4 has be dropped. The last build for .NET 4 is the NuGet version `1.3.1`. The code can be found on tag [.net-4.0](https://github.com/shawnmclean/Mandrill-dotnet/tree/net-4.0).
Async and Sync methods were merged into using the async pattern as suggested as [best practice](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/pfxteam/archive/2012/04/13/10293638.aspx) by the parallel programming team at microsoft. 

## Contributing

#### Building the source

For running tests, ensure to rename `AppSettings.example.config` to `AppSettings.config` and
set your own Api Key in the test project. Tests can be executed from rake: `rake test` or from any nunit test runner
tool.

You will also need to create a test template in your Mandrill account. The template's html content must be set to ```<span mc:edit="model1"></span>```.
The template's name must match the `TemplateExample` setting in the `AppSettings.config`; `Test` by default. In addition, the template's label must
match the `TemplateLabel` (default `test`).
